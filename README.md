# Swift Assignment 4 - Dataset Analysis

This repository contains my solutions for **Swift Assignment 4**.  
The project demonstrates how to work with real-world shipment tracking data in **JSON format** and analyze it using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**.

---

## 📌 Contents
- `dataset.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step solutions, analysis, and visualizations.
- `Swift Assignment 4 - Dataset.json` → JSON dataset containing FedEx shipment tracking details.
- `requirements.txt` → List of Python libraries needed to run the notebook.
